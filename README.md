This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Running under Linux

If you encounter any errors when trying to run the application locally via WSL or directly on a linux distribution, especially if you have problems starting the applicaiton due to corrupted line <br> endings (CRLF | LF ) or if the error appears to reside within the node_module script(s) themself(es), then run the following commands which will likely resolve your issue

### `sudo npm cache clean -f`

Execute a forcefull cashe purge of the current npm installation

### `sudo npm install -g n`

Install the specified npm module as superuser. The ' -g'  flag will install the module globally. The default installation location for the module 'n' is `/usr/local `

### `sudo n stable`

Fetches information about the currently installed version of node, as well as some additional information. 

### `sudo rm -rf node_modules` 

Will remove the corrupted node-module directory from the file system

### `sudo npm cache clean --force` 

This will clean (read: pruge) the npm cache

### `sudo npm install` 

Lastly, this command will (re-) install npm
